## Important: Public Issue Warning

This issue template creates a **public GitHub Issue**.

If you are reporting a real or suspected vulnerability, the preferred path is **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (Security tab -> **Report a vulnerability**) so details can be handled privately.

Use this public template only if:
- Private reporting is unavailable, or
- You are sharing a **sanitized, non-sensitive** security concern / hardening suggestion

⚠️ Do **not** include secrets, proof-of-concept exploit payloads, private endpoints, customer/org details, or step-by-step exploit instructions.

- [ ] I have not included secrets or sensitive data
- [ ] I have sanitized logs, examples, and environment details

If any box cannot be checked, please use private vulnerability reporting instead.
