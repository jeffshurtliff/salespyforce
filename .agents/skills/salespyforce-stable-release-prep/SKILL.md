# SalesPyForce Stable Release Prep

Prepare a locally validated SalesPyForce release candidate that follows the repository's maintainer runbook. 
The normal endpoint is a release-readiness report and verified local artifacts, not a commit or publication.

## Read repository authority first

Before changing state, read these files completely from the repository root:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. `docs/maintainers/releasing.md`

The runbook is the canonical procedure. This skill supplies SalesPyForce-specific 
routing and a deterministic artifact check; it does not replace stricter repository instructions.

Inspect `git status --short --branch` before switching branches or editing. Preserve unrelated 
work and stop if it cannot be isolated safely.

## Use SalesPyForce conventions

- Distribution and import package: `salespyforce`
- Version source: static `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml`
- Primary branch: `master`
- Release branch: `chore/<issue>-prepare-<version>-release`
- Stable tag: bare version such as `2.0.0`, created as an annotated tag
- Changelog: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, including unique MyST targets and comparison links
- Build frontend: Poetry, producing one source distribution and one pure-Python wheel
- Documentation: Sphinx with MyST; treat warnings as failures
- Supported Python versions and dependency floors: always derive from current `pyproject.toml` and CI rather than copying old values

Use the public repository metadata already tracked in the project. Never copy personal filesystem 
paths, private instance details, credentials, tokens, helper-file contents, or environment-specific 
identifiers into source, documentation, artifacts, commits, or release notes.

## Preserve authorization boundaries

A request to prepare the release authorizes reversible local work: read-only remote checks, creation 
or use of the policy-compliant local branch, version and changelog edits, documentation updates, 
validation, local builds, archive inspection, and temporary-environment smoke tests.

Require explicit authorization for each applicable external or history-changing action:

- creating or changing a GitHub issue, pull request, or release;
- staging, committing, merging, or pushing release changes;
- creating or pushing a release tag;
- uploading to TestPyPI or PyPI; or
- publishing, editing, or deleting externally visible release state.

Authorization for one action does not authorize later actions. By default, stop before staging or committing.

## Resolve the release facts

Confirm the exact stable version, current prerelease version, release date, issue number, previous 
reachable stable tag, target tag, release branch, repository remote, and required checks. Removing 
a prerelease suffix is acceptable only when the intended target is unambiguous, such 
as `2.0.0.dev0` to `2.0.0`. Never invent an issue number, reuse an existing tag or PyPI version, 
or guess the next development version.

The issue number refers to the release's dedicated tracking issue, opened from the **Maintainer 
Release** template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/maintainer-release.md`) with the `chore/` branch prefix. 
If no such issue exists, treat the issue number as unresolved and ask for it rather than proceeding.

Treat an unavailable remote or PyPI check as unresolved rather than proof that the version is unused. 
Do not open `local/`, `.env`, home-directory secret stores, decrypted helpers, or encrypted credential 
material merely to check release readiness.

## Perform local preparation

Follow runbook sections 1 through 5 and complete all local preparation checks before handing off:

1. Review the full change set since the prior stable tag and confirm release scope.
2. Establish the clean release branch from current `master` according to the issue policy.
3. Promote the exact stable version with `poetry version`; never edit `poetry.lock` manually or refresh dependencies incidentally.
4. Move `Unreleased` entries into the dated release section, reset the existing category skeleton with placeholders, rename MyST targets, and update comparison links.
5. Search maintained source, docs, workflows, tests, examples, and metadata for stale prerelease wording. Preserve historical references.
6. Run every repository release check, including Poetry lock validation, Ruff lint and format checks, pytest, the clean warning-as-error Sphinx build, and `git diff --check`.
7. Run integration tests only when required and an authorized environment is available. Never inspect or expose credential-bearing configuration to decide whether to run them.
8. Build clean candidate archives and require strict Twine validation.

After the build, run the repository-owned inspector from the repository root:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/salespyforce-stable-release-prep/scripts/inspect_release_artifacts.py \
  --expected-version "$RELEASE_VERSION" \
  --strict
```

First install the wheel with `--no-deps` in a new temporary virtual environment and assert `importlib.metadata.version('salespyforce')`. Then use a second clean virtual environment to install the wheel normally with its runtime dependencies and confirm `from salespyforce import Salesforce` succeeds. Do not require the public import in the dependency-free environment. These smoke tests supplement, but never replace, CI across all supported Python versions.

Review `git status`, the complete diff, generated-file ignore behavior, and candidate checksums. Fix in-scope failures and rerun affected and dependent checks. Do not weaken tests, dependency floors, lint rules, archive checks, or documentation warnings to obtain a passing result.

## Stop and report

Unless the user has explicitly authorized a later action, stop before runbook section 6. Report:

- resolved release facts and assumptions;
- each changed file and why it changed;
- every check with pass, fail, or intentionally skipped status;
- artifact filenames and SHA-256 checksums;
- blockers and manual reviews still required; and
- the exact next action requiring authorization.

If the user later authorizes publication work, reread the corresponding runbook section, revalidate 
its prerequisites, and perform only the specifically authorized action. Never reuse pre-merge candidate 
archives for publication.
