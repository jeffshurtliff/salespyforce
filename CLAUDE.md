# CLAUDE.md

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical contributor guide for this repository. **Read it
first and follow it in full** — every rule in it applies to Claude Code. This
file adds only the notes that are specific to working here with Claude Code.

Keep it that way: if a rule applies to every agent or contributor, put it in
`AGENTS.md`, not here. This file should stay short and never contradict
`AGENTS.md`.

## Environment and commands

- Dependency management and builds use **Poetry** (see `AGENTS.md` →
  "Dev environment"). Supported Python: 3.12 and 3.13.
- Before handing work back, run and report the same checks CI runs:
  - `poetry run ruff check .`
  - `poetry run ruff format --check .`
  - `poetry run pytest -q`
- Integration tests need real org credentials and are opt-in. Do not run
  `--integration` unless the user asks and a helper file is available.

## Header block attribution

When you change a file whose header block has `:Last Modified:` / `:Modified Date:`
(Python modules) or `Last Modified By:` / `Modified Date:` (shell scripts), update
them per `AGENTS.md` → "Module header blocks". For Claude Code specifically:

- Modifier field → `<orchestrating person> (via <exact model id>)`, e.g.
  `Jeff Shurtliff (via claude-sonnet-5)`. Use the real model ID you are running
  as (for example `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-opus-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`), not a
  marketing name. If the person prefers not to be named, use
  `Anonymous (via <model id>)`.
- Date field → today's local date, matching the existing format (`DD Mon YYYY`
  in Python headers, `YYYY-MM-DD` in shell scripts).
- Only touch these fields on files you actually changed.

## Secrets — never read, print, or commit

See `AGENTS.md` → "Secrets and local-only files". Treat these as off-limits:
`local/`, `$HOME/secrets/`, `.env*`, and `.github/encrypted/*.gpg`. They hold
real Salesforce credentials. Never open them, echo their contents, paste them
into code/docs/commit messages, or add real credentials to any tracked file. Use
`examples/helper.yml` (placeholder values) as the reference.

## Git

- Work on a branch, never directly on `master`. Branch prefixes and the
  issue-number convention are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (`feature/`, `fix/`,
  `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `ci/`, `security/`).
- Do not commit or push unless the user asks.
- Commit messages: past tense ("Added ...", "Fixed ..."), focused, and mention
  the file name when it reads naturally. The Claude Code harness appends the
  `Co-Authored-By:` and session trailers automatically — keep them.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for any user-visible change.

## Working style for this repo

- Plan non-trivial changes before editing; this project values small, localized,
  well-tested diffs over broad refactors.
- `/code-review` before opening a PR catches the correctness and cleanup issues
  reviewers here look for.
- Follow the pre-submit checklist in `AGENTS.md` before wrapping up.
