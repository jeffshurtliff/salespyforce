## Change Log
The change log can be found in the [documentation](https://salespyforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).

## Usage
This section provides basic usage instructions for the package.

### Importing the package
Rather than importing the base package, it is recommended that you import the primary `Salesforce` class using the 
syntax below.

```python
from salespyforce import Salesforce
```

### Initializing a Khoros object instance
The primary `Salesforce` object serves many purposes, the most important being to establish a connection to the 
Salesforce environment with which you intend to interact. As such, when initializing an instance of the `Salesforce` 
object, you will need to pass it the following information:
* The username and password of the API user
* The Organization ID of the Salesforce environment
* The Base URL and Endpoint URL
* The client ID, client secret, and security token

The `Salesforce` object can be initiated in two different ways:
* Passing the information directly into the object
* Leveraging a "helper" configuration file

#### Passing the information directly into the object
The environment and connection information can be passed directly into the `Salesforce` object when initializing it, 
as demonstrated in the example below.

```python
sfdc = Salesforce(
    username='admin.user@example.com',
    password='example123',
    org_id='4DJ000000CeMFYA0',
    base_url='https://example-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/',
    endpoint_url='https://example-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token',
    client_id='3MVG9gTv.DiE8cKRIpEtSN_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_TAoy1Zk_AKGukbqa4KbhM6nVYVUu6md',
    client_secret='7536F4A7865559XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX53797BEA88174713CC3C',
    security_token='2muXaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXoVKxz'
)
```

#### Leveraging a "helper" configuration file
As an alternative to passing the connection information to the `Salesforce` class in the way demonstrated above, a
"helper" configuration file in `yaml` or `json` format can be leveraged instead and passed to the `Salesforce` class
when initializing the object.

This is an example of how the configuration file would be written in YAML format:

```yaml
# Helper configuration file for the SalesPyForce package

# Define how to obtain the connection information
connection:
    # Define the credentials
    username: admin.user@example.com
    password: example123

    # Define the org information
    org_id: 4DJ000000CeMFYA0
    base_url: https://example-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/
    endpoint_url: https://example-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token

    # Define the API connection info
    client_key: 3MVG9gTv.DiE8cKRIpEtSN_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_TAoy1Zk_AKGukbqa4KbhM6nVYVUu6md
    client_secret: 7536F4A7865559XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX53797BEA88174713CC3C
    security_token: 2muXaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXoVKxz

# Define if SSL certificates should be verified when making API calls
ssl_verify: yes
```

The file can then be referenced using the `helper` argument when initializing the object instance, as shown below.

```python
HELPER_FILE = '/path/to/helper.yml'
sfdc = Salesforce(helper=HELPER_FILE)
```
