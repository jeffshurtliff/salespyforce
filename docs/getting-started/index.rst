Getting Started
===============

Use this section to go from a fresh install to your first successful Salesforce
API call with ``salespyforce``.

If you are new to the library, follow this order:

1. Read :doc:`overview` for requirements and capabilities.
2. Complete :doc:`installation` to install the package.
3. Work through :doc:`quickstart` for a first end-to-end example.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.9+
- Access to a Salesforce org
- A Salesforce user with API permissions
- Connected App credentials (client key/secret) and security token as needed

For deeper task-based walkthroughs after setup, continue to the :doc:`../guides/index` section.
For method and exception details, see the :doc:`../reference/index` section.
