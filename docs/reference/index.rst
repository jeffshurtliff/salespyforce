Reference
=========

Use this section when you need authoritative details for the ``salespyforce``
public API, including client behavior, helper utilities, and exception
semantics.

If you are already set up and want to jump straight to implementation details,
this section is the best starting point.

Recommended reading order:

1. Start with :doc:`client` for the core Salesforce client API and method usage.
2. Continue with :doc:`utilities` for helper functions and supporting tools.
3. Review :doc:`exceptions` to understand error types and handling patterns.

Use these pages as the source of truth for signatures, parameters, return
values, and raised exceptions.

If you are still onboarding, begin with :doc:`../getting-started/index` first.
For workflow-oriented examples and patterns, see :doc:`../guides/index`.
